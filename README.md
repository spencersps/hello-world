# hello-world

Some years back, I was dangling gently on the bar, on the bar accross the pole.
The pole that servered a team as post.
Just like where the soccer game is scored.
I had other crack head friends too, together we'll dangle along and roll around without thoughts that we could fall and break out necks.
Dangling gently on the bar.
